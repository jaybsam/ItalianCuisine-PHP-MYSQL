				Restaurant service practitioner provides high quality
				food and drink service to guests. A food service practitioner generally works in the commercial sector, offering
				a range of services to customers. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required,
				and the payment made by the guest. Therefore the practitioner has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively 
				with the guest in order to give satisfaction and thus maintain and grows the business.

				The practitioner is likely to work in a hotel or restaurant. 
				However, the size, nature and quality of these establishments can vary enormously 
				from internationally renowned hotel chains to smaller, privately-owned, more intimate restaurants.
				The quality and level of service provided and expected by guests will also vary. The styles of service will be 
				dependent on the targeted customer and can range from simple self-service operations to elaborate service styles where 
				dishes can be prepared at the guestsâ€™ table. In its more elaborate form, food and drink service can be likened to a form of theatre..</p>
