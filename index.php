				women who ate more whole grains consistently weighed less than women who ate fewer whole grains.
				Approximately 74,000 females ages 38 to 63 were studied for 12 years. The women who ate whole grain foods, such as
				100 percent whole wheat bread, had a 49 percent lower risk of weight gain than women who ate refined grain products,

				<div class="col-lg-8"><h2>Chicken Platter</h2><p>is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or
				battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken
				from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin,
					rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.</p>
