				<div class="col-lg-8"><h2>About Us</h2><p>Italian food is bold and satisfying without being heavy.
				It’s rich and textural and uses a whole palette of flavors,” says Michael Chiarello, the chef and owner
				of Bottega, in California’s Napa Valley, and author of the cookbook Bottega ($40, amazon.com). “Enjoying Italian 
				cuisine is more experiential, not intellectual. It comes from a more emotional place that’s very evocative.”

				And it evokes so much more than big plates of meatballs and chicken parmigiana. When Italian 
				immigrants first arrived on American shores, they couldn’t find their trusty olive oil, dried porcinis, prosciutto,
				 and balsamico, so they adapted to the ingredients that surrounded them, which resulted in far more meats and sausages in dishes, 
				 along with a healthy helping of garlic. And thus American-Italian food was born. But to mistake that for authentic, traditional Italian
				 cuisine would leave your tastebuds with only half the story.
